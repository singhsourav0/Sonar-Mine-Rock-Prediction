# Sonar-Mine-Rock-Prediction
This repository contains a Python-based project that utilizes a Sonar dataset to train a Logistic Regression model for classifying underwater objects as either rocks or mines. The model is trained and evaluated using accuracy as a metric. It can be used to predict the classification of new, unseen sonar data.
